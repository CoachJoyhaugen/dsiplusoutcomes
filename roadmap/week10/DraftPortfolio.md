# Draft Portfolio (WDI + DSI) 

- Submit your draft portfolio [through an issue here](https://github.com/ga-dc-outcomes/portfolio/blob/master/README.md) 

- We understand that you will likely want to include your final project, get everything as far as you can without your final project

- Remember a good portfolio has: 
    1. Your brand statement and/or an about me section. Don't leave the user guessing who you are and what you are up to 
    2. At least 3 projects. Include visuals of the projects (screenshots) and a brief description. WDI: link to raw code and the live site 
    3. Link to your resume 
    4. Contact information
