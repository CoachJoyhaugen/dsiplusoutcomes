## Communication
* We love getting to know you, and it makes our job easier, so be sure to be in touch with your local career coach.
* Bring questions you have to your outcomes sessions; almost always you will have some time at the end to talk with your career coach.
* If you slack or email us, please give us 24 hours to respond. We work with about 100 students at a time and want to be sure to give your question the attention it deserves. 
* Please do not just drop by without a meeting unless itâ€™s an emergency.
